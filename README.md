# Hotel Azuro

## Abstract:
[//]: <>
I built a hotel app that allows the user to login with specific user credentials, view their past and future bookings and review their total spend on rooms. The user is then able to select a date and find all available rooms for that day. There will be the ability to search through room type and book a desired room. Once the booking is complete, a confitmaion will dislay, then take the user back home where that new booking is viewable.

## Installation Instructions:
[//]: <>
1. Fork and clone [this repo](https://github.com/jsahim/hotel-azuro) and [this repo (backend API)](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api).
1. Copy the SSH key from the green "Code" button within each repo.
1. In your terminal, use the command `git clone git@github.com:[https://github.com/jsahim/hotel-azuro]`.
1. Run `npm install` in both local repositories.
1. Do NOT run `npm audit fix --force` when prompted.
1. Open the repo in your text editor to make any changes or inspect code.
1. Run `npm start` in your terminal for both repos.
1. Copy and paste the generated `localServer` address that your terminal provides for the front end repo into your browser address bar.

## Context:
[//]: <>
I was assigned this project on Tuesday, February 28th and had until Tuesday, March 7th to complete the project. I spent 3-5 hours a day on this project. We were in our final week of Mod 2 at Turing.

## Learning Goals:
[//]: <>
1. Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
1. Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
1. Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).
1. Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
1. Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
1. Ensure our app follows best practices for accessibility.
1. Practice talking about our code and high level technical concepts.
1. Improve group workflow.

## Technologies Used:
[//]: <>
- Fetch API
- Webpack
- Mocha & Chai
- LightHouse
- Wave Evaluation
- JavaScript
- CSS
- HTML

## Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <>
- Wins:
  - Utilized the fetch API to import data from a local server and post data updates to that server.
  - Successfully implemented micromodal to serve as cofirmation pop-up
  - Performed a complicated date sorting using the sort method as well as others
- Challenges:
  - This was a complicated project that put all of our experience with iterator methods to the test. We had to be coginizant of the data types we were working with and how they are mutable. 
  - It was difficult for me to avoid focusing on the visual aspect in favor of functionality due to time constraints.
